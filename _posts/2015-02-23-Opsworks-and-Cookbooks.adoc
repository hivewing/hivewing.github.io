= Opsworks and Cookbooks
:hp-tags: chef, opsworks

I'm currently enjoying learning all about opsworks and chef.  One thing I just ran into was that I am apparently unable to use "-" in my recipe names on OpsWorks.

When I try to "runCommand" for the stack, it tells me that my recipe name is invalid.  My recipe name is
[code]
  hivewing-sshd
  
Well - that stinks.  I guess I've become so used to clojure and saving my left pinky , I do dashes by default instead of underscores.

I put in this just to test, and the client-side validator works. 
[code]
  hivewing_sshd



Off to rename my cookbooks!
